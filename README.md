Hello! I am TechHog and this is a UI library I made called Lines Lib. 
Lines Lib is a UI library for roblox made mostly using the Drawing API. The Drawing API this is built off of, as far as I know, is not in Roblox, but in exploits
like Synapse, Sentinel, Protosmasher.
If you want to suggest anything or if you have any questions, you can contact me through my discord at TechHog#8984 (402264559509045258).
