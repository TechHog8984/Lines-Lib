Hello! I am TechHog and this is a UI library I made called Lines Lib. 
Lines Lib is a UI library for roblox made mostly using the Drawing library. The Drawing library this is built off of, as far as I know, is not in Roblox, but in exploits
like Synapse, Sentinel, Protosmasher.
If you want to suggest anything or if you have any questions, you can contact me at my discord, TechHog#8984 (402264559509045258).
