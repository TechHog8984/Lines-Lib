###  This is a todo list of future ideas / plans coming in Lines-Lib

- [ ] close events for Gui's and Section's

- [ ] update metatables for ease of accessing items. will depricate :GetEvent, :GetProperty, and :SetProperty as this is a better system of doing what all of those functions do. 

- [x] add __tostring metamethod to all objects

- [ ] add dropdowns
